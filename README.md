I ordered them 12/8/24 and they were shipped 12/12/24


They arrived 12/23/24 (very fast!)

I began by adding all the thru hole components on the bottom side of the horizontal piece. The bottom LEDs face forward. Afterwards, I added the surface mount LEDs on the back. I forgot that I didn't have any green 0603s, so I (safely) stole some from a nearby battery pack that was no longer in use. Unfortunately, I lost all but 1 from the very windy reflow station at home. 

Honestly, that was okay though since I really only needed 1 for my dad. I figure I'll give the other 4 as random gifts to my aerospace friends or something.

I then tested it of course, because I desperately wanted to see it, and I was also super nervous I put the 0603 LEDs in backwards since they're so tiny.

(I did put the green LED in backwards once, but I flipped it around and it lit up)


To power it, I used CR2032 batteries with a small piece of tin spot welded onto each side

About now, I realized I forgot to add a switch. I had always intended to glue the battery on, but I'm not sure why I never thought of the switch. 

To power it on I attached small wires onto a potentiometer between the battery + and the PCB. After gluing both the battery and the pot on, I realized that was not going to work since the red SMT LED was always on.

I went and found a button and replaced the pot.

It isn't ideal or the prettiest, but it is hidden on the bottom :)

I am happy with these results, but there's definitely room for improvement. If I manufacture these again I will definitely add a switch. I also might consider making the slits on each piece a tiny bit wider since there was some minor sanding I had to do. I am not sure if I would do this or not because the pieces fit so nicely after I gently tapped them together with a harder object.

I will also definitely increase the distance of the resistor holes. They were the right size and hold the resistors, but it was a little annoying to bend the wires nicely for them to fit. If the holes were slightly farther apart, they would fit so much better.

I did like how the + and - were on either side of the vertical piece. It made it easier to put the battery in place and not worry about covering up a port. It also let me place a button in and keep the wires relatively short. I would add a small hole or indent for the wire in the future though if I do keep the + on the opposite side. I can also just add a + and - to both sides so I can decide what to do depending on my materials. The school typically has everything I need, but if I am at home I might not have everything.
